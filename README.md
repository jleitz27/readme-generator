## User Story
AS A developer<br />
I WANT a README generator<br />
SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project<br />

  ## Description
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input<br />
WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository<br />
THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions<br />
WHEN I enter my project title<br />
THEN this is displayed as the title of the README<br />
WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions<br />
THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests<br />
WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options<br />
THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under<br />
WHEN I enter my GitHub username<br />
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile<br />
WHEN I enter my email address<br />
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions<br />
WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents<br />
THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README
